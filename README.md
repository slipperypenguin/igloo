## üíª&nbsp; Cluster Setup

#### Install
- Install / Update (with write permissions)
  - `curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_KUBECONFIG_MODE="644" sh -s -`
- Make sure systemd starts up after install/update (takes a few minutes)
  - `sudo systemctl status k3s`

#### Snippets
Useful snippets when using k3s
- `sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/cred/node-passwd`
- `sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/node-password.txt`
- `sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token`
- `journalctl -f`

#### Project structure
- `.github` - GitHub Actions configs, repo reference objects, other GitHub configs
- `cluster` - Charts + manifests deployed on cluster.

## ‚öô&nbsp; Hardware
_Note: in the process of evaluating which OS to go with on all devices._
Currently evaluating RaspiOS, HypriotOS, Ubuntu

## üåê&nbsp; Networking
TBD: currently experimenting here
1. network consists of [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager), [traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik), and [tailscale](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale). Aiming to have all traffic routed through Tailscale VPN over https.
2. network consists of [coredns](https://github.com/coredns/coredns), [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd), and [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns). **External-DNS** populates **CoreDNS** with all my ingress records and stores it in **etcd**. When browsing any of the services while on my home network, the traffic is being routed internally. When a DNS request is made from my domain or subdomains, it will use **coredns** as the DNS server, otherwise it'll whatever upstream DNS provided.

## üîß&nbsp; Tools
_Below are some of the tools I'm experimenting with, while working with my cluster_
